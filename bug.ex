The following Elixir code attempts to use `Enum.reduce` to sum a list of numbers, but it doesn't handle the case where the list is empty.  This leads to a `FunctionClauseError` because the `reduce` function doesn't have a clause to handle the empty list case.:

```elixir
defmodule MyList do
  def sum(list) do
    Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)
  end
end

IO.puts MyList.sum([1, 2, 3])  # Works fine
IO.puts MyList.sum([])       # Crashes
```
